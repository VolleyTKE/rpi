This folder is based off of the rpi project dress for weather found here:
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dress-for-the-weather

Some modifications have been made, honestly, the project page seems like it needs some updates as the pyowm api wrapper has changed.

When using this do not commit your api key to git= Instead

'export OWM_API_KEY=apikey_from_owm'
